# Solar-Tracker
Directs itself towards light
Solar trackers are devices used to orient photovoltaic panels, reflectors, lenses or other optical devices toward the sun. Since the sun's position in the sky changes with the seasons and the time of day, trackers are used to align the collection system to maximize energy production.
This project uses an Arduino as a controller, 4 LDR sensors (Light Dependent resistors) or photo-resistors for sensing direction of incidendent light, 2 Servo-Motors for changing direction of the solar plane.
The 4 sensors are placed on top of the Solar plane as shown
